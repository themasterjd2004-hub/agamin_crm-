# Tasks Module for CRM

Welcome to the [Task management software](https://djangocrm.github.io/info/features/tasks-app-features/) directory of [the CRM](https://github.com/DjangoCRM/django-crm/) project.
This module provides advanced **CRM task management** features, enabling users to efficiently create, assign, track, and collaborate on tasks within a unified CRM and task management software environment. This can be done either independently or as part of broader CRM workflows.

## Overview

This README provides an overview of the task system's structure, features, usage patterns, and its role as a **CRM task manager** within the larger CRM and task management stack.  
The Tasks management app is designed to enhance productivity and organization for teams and individuals. It integrates with project workflows, supports individual and collective tasks, and facilitates communication between team members. As a core part of the CRM task manager, it ensures that all task-related activities are efficiently managed within the CRM. This integration makes Django CRM a true CRM and task management solution ‚Äî avoiding the need for separate external tools.
